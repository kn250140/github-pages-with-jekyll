# Welcome to Solution Assurance for Vision

_I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about **Vision System Management Improvement Program!**_

_We are instituting a mandatory requirement to apply the **Solution Assurance Process** for all **New and Existing Vision Opportunities** regardless of size and, Vision projects will also be tracked and reported to leadership going forward._ 

_Specific actions are required of **Sales/Pre-Sales and PS, as detailed below.** Please be sure to review the required actions for your team._  





# Sales/Pre-Sales: Vision Solution Assurance Opportunity Qualification

**Solution Assurance** is an enterprise-level program to ensure solution requirements, risks, feasibility and technical customer profile are captured comprehensively prior to customer commitment. Where risks are captured, mitigation steps with owners are identified and appropriate corrective steps are executed for project success.  

Effectively immediately, all Vision deals are required to follow the **Solution Assurance process for assessment and approval. Completing a **Virtual Customer Profile (VCP) form is a prerequisite to initiate the Solution Assurance process.** The VCP captures the exceptions and unique requirements to be reviewed by the Vision SMEs as part of the Solution Assessment of the overall proposal. 

**The Sales and Pre-Sales teams need to ensure the VCPs are being completed for each opportunity.** This is a critical first step and needs to happen early in the sales process. The forms can be accessed via these links:

# PS: Vision Project Execution Tracking 

**PS is responsible for ensuring that the right project processes are followed and that information is captured and documented in the appropriate forms to enable successful execution and handover of the project between PS and Support.** PS is responsible for overall project management, including internal system setup and validation, task tracking and checklists and project guardrails.  

In line with the above process, Vision forms/tools have been created to support PS during the lifecycle of the project. 

**Note:** _These forms are mandatory for each deployment and can be accessed in the Vision Global Projects and Forms page on the Banking Solution Assurance Teams site or at the following links:_
